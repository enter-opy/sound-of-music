<b>
    Sound of music is a multiband bit crusher with 3 bands. The spectrum analyzer allows you to
    visualize the audio and control the band parameters. Move Freq 1 and Freq 2 sliders to adjust bandwidths. There
    are 3 instances of crush, downsample, jitter and clip each for the 3 bands. Select bands on the spectrum
    analyzer to switch between each of them. Stereo/Mono and Dry/Wet work globally.
